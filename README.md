# MOSS-Forward4

Welcome to MOSS Forward4 project. Here is an informal community to push forward the [MOSS](https://txsun1997.github.io/blogs/moss.html) launched by [Dr。 Tianxiang.Sun](https://github.com/txsun1997) from Fudan University NLP lab.

## Responsibility
Currently, the major responsibility of this repo is to track all the response from MOSS, where the benchmark query is provided by [Best ChatGPT Prompts](https://www.emergentmind.com/best). The result be will summarized and a accuracy score will be calculated by below formula：

> accuracy = (matched_response_num * 1.0 + matched_response_with_extra_prompt_num * 0.5 + unmatched_response_num) / ALL_QUERY_NUM )


## Current Result:

**Queries: Top 10**

**Accuracy: 50%**

See [benchmark/response](../main/benchmark/responses) for more details
